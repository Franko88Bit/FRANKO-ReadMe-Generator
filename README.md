# FRANKO-ReadMe-Generator
A beautiful thing - command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.

As a developer i am creating a README generator so that a user can generate a readme from my javascript program. So that a user can generate a readme easily and faster without manually typing to create a readme file.

Since this application is not deployed like usual via github pages, I will provide a link to a video demonstrating its functionality. I will use technology to record the video from the computer and verbally walk through the functionality of this app, end to end.

When you run node node.js on command line, you will be faced with some questions and after answering all the questions, a professional readme file called Professional_README.md will be created with the JS code in this program.
