# FRANKO-ReadMe-Generator
A beautiful thing - command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.

As a developer i am creating a README generator so that a user can generate a readme from my javascript program. So that a user can generate a readme easily and faster without manually typing to create a readme file.
